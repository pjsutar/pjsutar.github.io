Pawan is an accomplished engineer who loves to work in research and development environment. He has two years of in-house CFD solver development and testing experience at [Compbustion and Propulsion Research Laboratory at IUPUI, Indianapolis]. His research mainly focused on extending the capacbility of NASA and IUPUI Wave Rotor analysis software to incorporate different physical phenomena. During his internship at [Industrial Assessment Center at IUPUI], he has participated in four industrial energy audits, contributing to the energy cost saving of over $50,000. Pawan completed his master's in [Mechanical Engineering](https://et.iupui.edu/departments/mee/programs/me/) (Thesis option) from [Purdue University, Indianapolis] under the supervision of [Dr. M. Razi Nalim]. His interests revolve around different specialized topics in fluid and gas dynamics, CFD, FEA, numerical analysis, controls and system engineering. As a professional with ability to create value, Pawan has enjoyed paricipation in different technical and leadership roles throughout his career.
