### Pressure-Loss CFD Analysis of Cummins 6-Cylinder Exhaust Manifold

Engine exhaust system plays crucial role in smooth and efficient operation of engines. Stringent emission control legislations in automotive sectors have compelled engineers and researchers to rethink the design aspects of combustion chamber and exhaust system. As a pioneer in automotive sector, Cummins is committed to deliver breakthrough technology to improve engine performance in sustainable fashion. An innovative design of 6-cylinder exhaust gas manifold suitable for exhaust gas recirculation was developed by Cummins.

This project focused on estimating the total loss of exhaust gas pressure through the exhaust manifold. Computational results were first validated for analytical calculations and later for bench-top experimental data. Commercial ANSYS Fluent software was used to prepare the finite volume model. Capturing the fine details in free surface flows and combustion simulations requires an extremely fine polyhedral mesh. Polyhedral Unstructured Mesh Adaptation (PUMA) technology automatically refines polyhedral mesh to capture splash details, while leaving courser mesh in place for faster solve times. Strategy is to take advantage of this technology for faster and more accurate results. Steady-state, pressure-based, absolute solver was used with standard k-epsilon turbulence model to perform the analysis.

The simulation results were validated for experimental data by difference less than 10%. Major accomplishment was that the computational analysis strategies were repeatable and could be used conveniently for further designs.
