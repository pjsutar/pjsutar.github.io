### Self-Driving Vehicle Control

This project was part of the University of Toronto's first course titled, 'Introduction to Self-Driving Cars', under ego vehicles specialization program. Thanks to Indiana University for providing the access to enroll in this course. This is an advanced course in the domain of ego vehicles control, which helped me to understand commonly used hardware for self-driving cars, identify the main components of the self-driving software stack, program vehicle modelling and control and analyze the safety frameworks and current industry practices for vehicle development. Some of the main achievements are as listed below.

• Developed kinematic and dynamic bicycle models of cars with velocity (longitudinal control) and steering angle (lateral control) inputs
• Implemented controller in PYTHON and developed working simulation of an autonomous vehicle in Carla Simulator
• Integrated vehicle modeling and controller design into a complete autonomous vehicle control system
• Familiarity with Probabilistic Fault Tree Analysis, FMEA, HAZOP, FuSa-HARA, SOTIF and Waymo safety and testing standards
