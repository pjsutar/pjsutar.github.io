### Two-Stroke Free-Piston Range Extender Engine for Hybrid Vehicles

A free-piston engine is a linear, 'crankless' internal combustion engine, in which the piston motion is not controlled by a crankshaft but determined by the interaction of forces from the combustion chamber gases.
The purpose of all such piston engines is to generate power. In the free-piston engine, this power is not delivered to a crankshaft but is instead extracted by incorporating a linear alternator directly into the pistons to produce electrical power. A prototype 5 kW free-piston engine research and development project was undertaken at the IC Engines Laboratory at KIT's College of Engineering (Autonomous), Kolhapur (India). The device is currently under development at the College of Engineering, Pune (India). Some of the key features are as listed below.

- Opposed pistons configuration with two-stroke engines 
- Crank and crankcase were eliminated due to linear design and an auxiliary compression chamber was built to facilitate crankcase compression
- Ignition system was redesigned to use the same spark plugs precisely for linear engine
- An arduino-based fuel injection control system
- Linear generator had electromagnetic coils as a stator and permanent magnets as a rotor
- Data acquisition system to record pressure and temperatures at different points, fuel flow rates and electricity generation
